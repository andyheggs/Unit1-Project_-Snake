**Description**

S\_N\_A\_K\_E is a modern take on the classic browser game, Snake. In this game, players control a snake that grows longer as it eats food, navigating through the game area without running into walls or itself.

**Background**

The inspiration for S\_N\_A\_K\_E came from the countless hours spent playing Snake on old Nokia phones during my university days. This game holds nostalgic value and brings back fond memories of simpler times.
